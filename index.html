                    Tucked away on the edge of Wellington is this rare suburban villa and museum. As you walk up the large 
                    avenue of Wellingtonia trees the red-brick villa is unexpectedly revealed offering a chance to immerse 
                    yourself in a past era.The time capsule, which is furnished with original wallpapers, Maw’s tiles and 
                    gold medal winning fireplaces, transports you back to the pre-First World War ‘country house’ lifestyle. 
                    Packed full with everyday items belonging to the families who lived here, you are sure to feel the familiarity 
                    and comfort of this home despite all the features of a grander house, such as the Billiard Room, Drawing Room 
                    and impressive Staircase Hall. The 5 acres of garden is complete with glass houses, conservatory, kennels, pigsties 
                    and stables and is perfect for a wander or a game of croquet. You are welcome to take refreshments in our Edwardian 
                    tea-room or out on the veranda.

                        Originally built by a brewer on three acres of land in 1879, Sunnycroft was initially modest in scale. 
                        However, in 1899, Mary Jane Slaney, the widow of a wine and spirit merchant, extended the house to its present layout. 
                        The Landers, who were its subsequent owners, have left a lasting legacy to Sunnycroft. They were careful stewards who 
                        cherished the past, preserving the house's historical charm and essence. Their commitment to retaining the house's original 
                        features and furnishings means that, as you walk through its doors, you can truly immerse yourself in the captivating ambiance
                         of an Edwardian home, where the echoes of a bygone era still resonate.

                        Once prolific on the outskirts of towns and cities, this style of house, sited on prime commercial land, 
                        is rapidly diminishing as they are knocked down or transformed into flats, hospitals, offices, and schools. 
                        However, the house at Sunnycroft provides you with a unique opportunity to explore a rare survivor in today's world,
                         as it stands encroached on all sides by modern housing estates. This enclave of history amidst the ever-expanding urban 
                         landscape allows you to step back in time and appreciate a piece of architectural heritage that is becoming increasingly scarce.

                        Sunnycroft remains intact, complete with the original interior fixtures and fittings, many of which are still in place.
                         This preservation not only ensures its historical authenticity but also bestows upon it a unique character and intimacy
                          that is often lacking from larger properties. This authenticity is incredibly evocative of the time and pace in which 
                          it was built, making it a remarkable piece of history that continues to stand the test of time. As you explore its 
                          well-preserved rooms and corridors, you'll find yourself transported to a bygone era, where the past comes to life 
                          in exquisite detail, allowing you to connect with the rich tapestry of history that Sunnycroft embodies.
